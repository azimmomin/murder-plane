INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
Inside of the MurderPlane.zip file is an unsigned IPA file, the XCode Project I used to build to my phone, and a demo of me playing the game on my phone.
- If you can't install that IPA, I've included the Xcode project that you can use to create a new signed build
- If all else fails, you can load the unity project and click File -> 'Build And Run'
- I've also included a video that demo's my work.
